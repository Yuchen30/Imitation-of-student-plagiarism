# Imitation-of-student-plagiarism

1.	Problem intro and motivation
Plagiarism has long been in the scenario. Students usually plagiarize content while doing their assignments. There has been a lot of increase in plagiarism in the last 15-20 years which is not good for studies. Plagiarism damages study fundamentally. The motivation for this work is to help people know about student behaviors of cheating. Our main purpose is to see the effect of copy rate , recognition rate and study groups on the average score of the students. For this project, I do an agent-based model that allows cheating behavior in the context of homework completion to be studied. We are interested in gaining insights into the factor-extracurricular activities that influence cheating behavior. The model allows us to explore the behavior of students when presented with homework assignments.

2.	Approach
In hypothesis part, assume that there is no effect of number of students in our model. 
Our analysis will be based on different cases. Initially with zero copy rate. Then increase it to 50. Increase copy rate, average score will increase.
Then increase recognition rate with 50. Then average score will decrease.
Cases for increasing groups with and without copy rate. 
We will analyze the effect of copy rate, recognition rate and study-groups on the average score of the class.

3. Experiment
In this project, we choose netlogo as the software, which is a multi-agent modeling environment. Netlogo version is the newest version: Netlogo 6.2.0.
